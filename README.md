## See Also

[arminask/windows-arm-apps](https://github.com/arminask/windows-arm-apps) has been maintaining a similar list as well.

Currently, the apps listed in the this and that repo have some differences from each other. Either repo may have some apps that the other doesn't have. So check both lists if you are looking for something.

I will try to merge the two lists in the future.

## The Main List

This main list only contains software that is officially published.

Additionally, a list of third-party build or port of software is here: [3rd-party.md](3rd-party.md)
